# ShopifyStore
Shopify Backend Developper Job Application

MERN application (React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB)

All CRUD Funstionality is included. 

Extra functionality : Filtering based on fields/inventory count/tags/other metadata. My app allows users to filter based on inventory/store items based on the tags. 
(I also added image uplaods and display them as a thumbnail in the frontend :) ) 

Here is what the website should look like

To use the Tag search, you would type in the tag for example selleitalia then click enter. The user can search for many tags this way.
